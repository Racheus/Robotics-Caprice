This is a project I 've thought so many times. For piece of love, passion, and hope.I really want to mark some shining time in my short-and-tired undergraduate life.This repo contains a lot of notes about basic Robotics in Chinese(always,always and always aiming at examination,huh~),some python and matlab script as well.

I'm not certain about how long I can insist.🤕🤕🤕For the reason that I 'm just a regular student and have such a lot of courses in one semester.😭😭😭

However I will try my best to maintain it.

If planning it by pose space, the robot will have some *configuration mutation points*,which may harmful in practical engineering applications.(Maybe my method have something wrong?**MARK here**)

### Final works of Robotics 2023-2024-2

This time we make a model from *Solidworks*. After using Solidworks to build the model, we used the relevant theories of robotics to calculate the reachable space, kinematics (forward and inverse), dynamics (forward and inverse) and other functions in MATLAB, and finally combined Simulink to simulate the kinematics and dynamics.

This is a project I 've thought so many times. For piece of love, passion, and hope.I really want to mark some shining time in my short-and-tired undergraduate life.This repo contains a lot of notes about basic Robotics in Chinese(always,always and always aiming at examination,huh~),some python and matlab script as well.

I'm not certain about how long I can insist.🤕🤕🤕For the reason that I 'm just a regular student and have such a lot of courses in one semester.😭😭😭

However I will try my best to maintain it.
